= How to apply Extent Reports to Katalon Studio project

This repository presents a link:https://katalon.com/katalon-studio[Katalon Studio] project which integrates the link:https://extentreports.com/[Extent Reports] to compile a test execution report in HTML. The Extent Reports enables users to customize the content of the report.

== Problem to solve

In the Katalon Community forum, there was a topic

- https://forum.katalon.com/t/is-possible-to-add-in-html-or-pdf-reports-the-git-current-branch/163746

Let me quote the part of the pos here:

I´m trying to customize the html and pdf report in order to show some usefull information.

I would like to show the current branch of the repository that I´m testing in the Excecution environment section of the report

The original poster tried to customize the built-in HTML report compiled by Katalon Studio, but he could not find out the way. I knew the https://forum.katalon.com/t/is-possible-to-add-in-html-or-pdf-reports-the-git-current-branch/163746/3[answer] to him. The Katalon built-in report is not customizable at all. Then, what should he do?

== Solution

In the link:https://forum.katalon.com/t/is-possible-to-add-in-html-or-pdf-reports-the-git-current-branch/163746/7[following post], I suggested link:https://extentreports.com/[Extent Reports]. Using it, he should be able to compile a new test execution report. It would be easy to insert the Git branch name, like `GIT BRANCH: master`.


== Description

In the GitHub, I found a public repository by https://github.com/coty[coty], Katalon CTO.

- https://github.com/coty/extent-report-sample

The repository contains a Katalon Studio project. Katalon users can learn how to use the Extent Reports in a Katalon project.

I forked the project to form a new GitHub repository at

- https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project

I made some changes in the forked repository, and got a success to create a HTML report that displays :

== Environment

I used

- macOS Sonoma 14.7.3
- Katalon Studio Free 10.1.0

== How to run the demo

You can run the project and see the demonstration as follows:

1. Clone the Git repository https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project to your local machine.
2. Open the project with your Katalon Studio. Execute "Test Suites/Suite002". It will take 30 seconds or so.
3. When the Test Suite finished, you will find `<projectDir>/Extent/yyyyMMdd_hhmmss/kseqatestreport.html`, which looks something like this:

== How the project is coded

link:https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project[My demo project] is entirely a fork from the coty's link:https://github.com/coty/extent-report-sample[original] project.

I made several changes my demo project. You can find the exact differences between the original and my derivatives at the GitHub diff compare page at

- https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project/compare/original…0.1.0

Please note the following 3 points:

=== No change in `com.katalon.extent.report.ExtentReport` class

The link:https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project/blob/master/Keywords/com/katalon/extent/report/ExtentReport.groovy[com.katalon.extent.report.ExtentReport] class
is the core part of the project, which implements the interface between your Katalon test scripts and the Extent Reports library. I made no change in it. link:https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project/blob/master/Keywords/com/katalon/extent/report/ExtentReport.groovy[The class source in my demo project] is just
the same as link:https://github.com/coty/extent-report-sample/blob/master/Keywords/com/katalon/extent/report/ExtentReport.groovy[the original].

Therefore, whenever the original repository is updated, I would not hesitate to do "git pull" from the original repository in to my fork.

=== A new class `com.kazurayam.ks.ExtentReportsKeyword`

I added a new class link:https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project/blob/master/Keywords/com/kazurayam/ks/ExtentReportsKeyword.groovy[`com.kazurayam.ks.ExtentReports`]. This class borrows all the methods of the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project/blob/master/Keywords/com/katalon/extent/report/ExtentReport.groovy[`com.katalon.extent.report.ExtentReport`] class as component. However, my class is capable to inject my own customization in to the report. For example, see the `startEReport` method:

[source, groovy]
----
include::../Keywords/com/kazurayam/ks/ExtentReportsKeyword.groovy[lines=22..28]
----

=== Changed the TestListener

I edited the `Test Listeners/ExtentReportsListener.groovy` so that it no longer calls the original `com.katalon.extent.ExtentReport` keyword. Instead, It calls the new `com.kazurayam.ks.ExtentReportKeyword`. You can see the diff of old/new `ExtentReportsListener` at:

- link:https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project/compare/original..0.0.1#diff-f4ea12441d88d4878f66d8412e61ca8c2de6bdb20a6d99f31f62a5fa655857c0[diff between old/new ExtentReportsListener]

I would quote a small piece out of the changes:

[source]
----
        @BeforeTestSuite
        def sampleBeforeTestSuite(TestSuiteContext testSuiteContext) {
-               //CustomKeywords.'com.katalon.extent.report.ExtentReport.deleteFolderContents'()
-               CustomKeywords.'com.katalon.extent.report.ExtentReport.attachEReport'(testSuiteContext, "Extent Report", "KSE QA Test Report")
+               //CustomKeywords.'com.kazurayam.ks.ExtentReportsKeyword.deleteFolderContents'()
+               CustomKeywords.'com.kazurayam.ks.ExtentReportsKeyword.attachEReport'(testSuiteContext, "Extent Report", "KSE QA Test Report")
        }
----

A warning. If the original repository by @coty is updated in future and if I do "git pull" into the fork, then it is likely to encounter some merge conflicts over the `Test Listeners/ExtentReportsListener.groovy`. However, I believe the original repository will be left unmaintained in future. So that, I wouldn't mind this risk too much.

== How the external dependancies are managed?

If you look into the `<projectDir>/Dependencies`, you will find several jar files on which this project depends.

I have a doubt about this list of dependencies. Do we need the `extentreport-5.1.1..jar` and `katalon_generated_extentreports-5.1.1.jar` together? It looks duplicating, isn't it? But for now I wouldn't stick to this point.

If you are going to use Externt Reports in your own Katalon project, you want to copy those jar files into the `Drivers` folder of your own project.

When you accidentaly removed all those files, you can restore them by invoking a Gradle build:

[source]
----
:~/katalon-workspace/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project (master *)
$ rm Drivers/*
:~/katalon-workspace/

$ gradle katalonCopyDependencies
...
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
1 actionable task: 1 executed
:~/katalon-workspace/

$ ls Drivers/
katalon_generated_extentreports-5.1.1.jar
katalon_generated_freemarker-2.3.32.jar
katalon_generated_gson-2.10.1.jar
katalon_generated_lombok-1.18.26.jar
katalon_generated_reactive-streams-1.0.4.jar
katalon_generated_rxjava-3.1.8.jar
----

If you are interested in how Gradle works in this project, you should study the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/extent-reports-applied-to-katalon-studio-project/blob/master/build.gradle[build.gradle] file.
